219	CYP2A6 *1A/*1A_non-renal nicotine clearance	We found significant differences between CYP2A6 *1A/*1A , CYP2A6 *1A/*1B , and CYP2A6 *1B/*1B  groups in total nicotine clearance (17.2+/-5.2, 19.0+/-6.4, and 20.4+/-5.9, P<0.02), non-renal nicotine clearance (16.4+/-5.0, 18.5+/-6.2, and 19.8+/-5.7, P<0.01), and the plasma trans-3-hydroxycotinine/cotinine ratio (0.26+/-0.1, 0.26+/-0.1, and 0.34+/-0.1, P<0.001).	influences
87	CYP2C8 *3_R-(-)-ibuprofen	The main genetic factor for reduced clearance of R-(-)-ibuprofen is the CYP2C8 *3  allele, whereas the clearance for S-(+)-ibuprofen is influenced by CYP2C8 *3  and CYP2C9 *3  alleles to a similar extent.	isAssociatedWith
161	CYP2D6  *4/*4_incidence of hot flashes	CONCLUSION: In tamoxifen-treated patients, women with the CYP2D6  *4/*4  genotype tend to have a higher risk of disease relapse and a lower incidence of hot flashes, which is consistent with our previous observation that CYP2D6 is responsible for the metabolic activation of tamoxifen to endoxifen.	decreases
228	3435C >T polymorphism_digoxin	Evaluation of the impact of ABCB1 2677G >A,T and 3435C >T polymorphism on salivary digoxin secretion revealed significant differences in digoxin stimulated saliva/serum ratio between patients stratified by 2677G >A,T genotype (TT, TA> GT, GA> GG, p < 0.01).	isAssociatedWith
181	ABCB1_pharmacodynamic studies with pravastatin	METHODS: Twenty children with HeFH (aged 4.9-15.6 years) and 12 cardiac transplant recipients (aged 4.4-18.7 years and receiving triple immunosuppressive medication) who had participated in previous pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies with pravastatin were genotyped for the -11187G > A and 521T > C SNPs in the SLCO1B1 gene and for the 2677G >  T / A and 3435C > T SNPs in the ABCB1 gene.	influences
86	CYP2C9 *3_clearance for S-(+)-ibuprofen	The main genetic factor for reduced clearance of R-(-)-ibuprofen is the CYP2C8 *3  allele, whereas the clearance for S-(+)-ibuprofen is influenced by CYP2C8 *3  and CYP2C9 *3  alleles to a similar extent.	influences
263	UGT1A1 rs887829 T allele_plasma atazanavir clearance	By multivariate analysis, higher peak on-treatment bilirubin levels were found to be associated with the UGT1A1 rs887829 T allele (P=6.4x10(-12)), higher baseline hemoglobin levels (P=4.9x10(-13)), higher baseline bilirubin levels (P=6.7x10(-12)), and slower plasma atazanavir clearance (P=8.6x10(-11)).	decreases
314	MDR1-C1236T_imatinib response	GG vs. non-GG genotype for CYP3A5-A6986G adjusted OR: 0.246; 95% CI (0.116, 0.519); P<0.001 and TT vs. non-TT genotype for MDR1-C1236T adjusted OR: 0.270; 95% CI (0.110, 0.659); P=0.004 &MDR1-C3435T adjusted OR: 0.289; 95% CI (0.135, 0.615); P=0.001 polymorphisms were independent factors predicting imatinib response in multivariate analysis.	influences
98	CYP2D6 *2_pharmacokinetic parameters of metoprolol	We evaluated the effect of polymorphic alleles (CYP2D6 *2 , CYP2D6 *10 , CYP2C19 *2  and CYP2C19 *3 ), age, gender, and heart failure on the pharmacokinetic parameters of metoprolol.	influences
172	-174  G / C IL-6 polymorphism_anti-inflammatory action of fenofibrate	A relationship between the -174  G / C IL-6 polymorphism and the anti-inflammatory action of fenofibrate reported might be useful in the optimization of the treatment regimen in patients receiving this class of drugs.	influences
272	UGT1A1  T / T_bilirubin-related atazanavir discontinuation	Discriminatory properties of UGT1A1  T / T genotype for predicting bilirubin-related atazanavir discontinuation through 96 weeks after antiretroviral initiation were estimated.	influences
18	ACE_quinapril	We studied the relation between renin-angiotensin system (RAS) related gene polymorphisms, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D), angiotensinogen (AGT) M253T and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) A1166C, and the effect of quinapril, an ACE inhibitor with high tissue-binding affinity, on preventing restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).	influences
246	GNB3  CT / TT_clonidine	Besides higher baseline norepinephrine levels, the presence of both ARDA(2)C WD/DD and GNB3  CT / TT genotypes showed a positive predictive value of 82% and a negative predictive value of 79% for good clonidine response.	isAssociatedWith
